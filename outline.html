          <h2>Box-Car Racers</h2>
          <p>
            Moving with current times and the new curriculum. we are offering a
            <strong>STEM based activity project</strong> to schools. Our aim is
            to offer exciting but educational activities that can be delivered
            with an <strong>outdoor/active focus.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We have put together a project for pupils to complete that is
            <strong>customisable.</strong> It will take a number of hours
            (depending on delivery requirements by the school).

          <h2>Planning and Design</h2>
          <p>
            Our  project “boxcar racers” consists of a <strong>digital workbook
          </strong> which can be completed either on a computer or printed and
            written on.
          </p>
          <p>
            The workbook aims to start a design engineering process where a
            pupil works to create a car body. As they progress, they will
            research <strong>vehicle design, sketch ideas, build scale models
            and work both independently as well as with a partner</strong>, to
            eventually critique and consolidate ideas as a group of six.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="page-image">

        </div>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <h2>Team Building</h2>
          <p>
            The workbook is supported by <strong>Lesson guidance notes</strong>
            which include additional side projects to develop understanding of
            key areas such as <strong>aerodynamics.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            As the project progresses the <strong>design teams</strong> will use
            the cardboard provided to increase the scale of their designs to
            construct their final idea which will be large enough for the pupils
            to sit in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Encouraged by the booklet they will then research an
            <strong>ethical company,</strong> so that they can write slogans and
            logos which they will then decorate their racer with as a “sponsor”
            would a race car.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will then visit your site and host a <strong>race day</strong>
            with your class, where the pupils will construct our <strong>unique
            car chassis and steering mechanism</strong> onto which they will
            attach their prepared cardboard bodywork.

          <h2>Evaluating</h2>
          <p>
            After completing our big and exciting race day, following the final
            stages of the booklet, pupils will complete an <strong>evaluation
            exercise</strong> and review using media and technology to record
            their experience.

          <h2>Presenting and Awards</h2>
          <p>
            The project is then completed by the team <strong>writing a pitch
            </strong> which they will deliver to the year group below which will
            bolster evidence to achieve standards which we replicate from STEM
            to allow us to decide whether your class achieves <strong>bronze,
            silver or gold standard</strong> in the boxcar awards.

          <p>
            The entire project is designed to be <strong>sustainable and
            environmentally friendly</strong> with all elements used being
            <strong>reusable or recyclable, activity focused</strong> and
            <strong>encouraging engagement, participation</strong> and a sense
            of <strong>competitive education.</strong> </p>
