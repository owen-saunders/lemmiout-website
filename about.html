            Lemmiout Activities was founded by a pair of <strong>outdoor
            education instructors,</strong> with <strong>25+ years of experience</strong>
            between them in coaching and educating children and young people
            in the outdoors, in accordance with the national curriculum.

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>
            We have a <strong>broad range of experience</strong> from working
            with <strong>large numbers of young people</strong> at schools.
            And out and about across the <strong>UK and Europe.</strong> To
            individual bespoke activity courses, GCSE courses, Adult development
            events and much more.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an organisation we believe that education can be <strong>exciting
            as well as informative,</strong> that it should be delivered in such
            a way that it appeals to both the Top of the class talented pupils
            and to those that find education challenging.  It should include all
            pupils and should be memorable and so <strong>encourage future
            interest in learning.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Our projects involve a lot of <strong>“stealth learning"</strong>
            ensuring pupils do not zone out or switch off in the first few
            minutes.

          <h2>Lemmiout Activities are currently offering 3 packages.</h2>
          <h3>Option 1</h3>
          <p>
            We can deliver the project to your school <strong>in person,
            </strong> we will offer to run an <strong>introduction lesson,
            </strong> and to talk the <strong>delivery staff</strong> through
            the program. We will leave all of the <strong>required resources
            </strong> with the school. We will then return on an agreed date and
            <strong>run the “big race day”</strong> and also visit to see the
            <strong>review session.</strong>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <h3>Option 2</h3>
          <p>
            We can deliver <strong>every aspect</strong> of the project to your
            pupils <strong>ourselves.</strong> This will be available in the
            <strong>format that works best</strong> for your school, whether
            that is 1 lesson a week for a number of weeks or every day for 6
            days we can <strong>tailor this to work best for you.</strong>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <h3>Option 3</h3>
          <p>
            The project can be delivered to the school, <strong>left with the
            delivery staff.</strong> And we will <strong>return for the race
            day.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope to offer <strong>localised staff training in the near future
            </strong> for delivery at your school and the surrounding area thus
            making option 3 a little easier for you.
